        <h1>Practical Tips for Writing Scripts</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Reusable Functions</h2>
            Along with reusing other people's scripts and folders, you can also write code that you can reuse
yourself.Rather than writing a new script for each site, you can create a script that you can use on any contact form you write. So, you should aim to make your code as reusable as possible, rather than writing a script that will only
work with one page.

            <h2> Using External JavaScript Files</h2>
            Whenever you are going to use a script in more than one page it' s a good idea to place it in an external
JavaScript file. Rather than including this
script on every page, if the script lives in an external JavaScript file:
<ul>
    <li> You do not have to copy and paste the same code into several files.</li>
    <li>The file size of the pages is smaller because the JavaScript is in one file that is included on each
        page rather than repeated in multiple pages. </li>
        <li> If you need to change something about the script, you need to change only the one script, not
            every page that uses it.</li>
</ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Place Scripts in a Scripts Folder</h2>
            When you use external scripts you should create a special scripts folder â€” just as you would an
images folder. This helps improve the organization of your site and your directory structure. Whenever
you need to look at or change a script, you know exactly where it will be.
 You should also use intuitive names for your script files so that you can find them quickly and easily.
